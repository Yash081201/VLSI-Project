# VLSI-Project
# Design a 4-bit Microprocessor

# Verilog Code
The project includes Verilog code that was initially written and tested for functionality. The code was then synthesized using Design Vision, integrating the constraints and the technology libraries applicable.

# Layout and Schematic using Innovus
The synthesized Verilog code was uploaded to Innovus software along with the .LEF files to produce the required layout and schematic, which were subsequently imported into Cadence Virtuoso.

# Simulation & Testing
DRC, LVS, and PEX Checks: The design went through standard checks to ensure it met the necessary design rules, and was structurally and electrically sound. HSPICE Simulation: Waveforms were generated under various conditions to analyze the performance of the circuit. Specific setups in HSPICE were used to simulate the circuit and generate output waveforms.

# AEDP Calculation
Area Calculation: The total area occupied by the cell layout. Energy and Delay: Measurement of the energy consumption and delay, which influence the performance of the designed circuit. AEDP Metric: Calculation of Area-Energy-Delay Product to gauge the efficiency of the design.
